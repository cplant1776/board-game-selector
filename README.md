# Board Game Selection Web App

A web app to assist users in finding a board game to play based on a series of optional criteria. The data used is drawn from [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) using a combination of [this tool](https://github.com/mcdemarco/bgg_pull/tree/fans) and some minor scraping on my own part.

## Motivation

This project has three (selfish) objectives:

1. Increase familiarity with Spring framework and MVC architecture
2. Gain some experience using Java beyond completing exercises
3. Refresh myself on the basics of Bootstrap

## Current Roadmap (To-Do)

1. Add sort-by filter for search results
1. Add mechanics/category tags
1. Make it pretty
